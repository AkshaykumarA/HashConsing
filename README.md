# HashConsing & Expression Parser in Python


## Goals of the project
The main code is an implementation of an optimization technique called "hash consing". The main purpose of the project is to evaluate arithmetic expressions represented as a tree data structure in a more efficient way by reusing identical sub-expressions.
The program takes an arithmetic expression as input, which is a tree-like structure consisting of constant values, variables, and operations such as addition and subtraction. It then evaluates the expression by traversing the tree and performing the necessary calculations. To improve the performance of the evaluation, we used hash consing to identify identical sub-expressions and reuse their previously calculated results instead of recalculating them. This reduces the number of calculations needed to evaluate the expression, and may lead to faster execution times in large expressions.
